# gitRDunExifExample

Parse Terabytes of Exif off a directory recursively using all cores of your processor (hopefully) 

Mine only took 20% CPU still with this main function.

I ran about 5 copies of this program concurrently overnight on different directories and they finished in 5 hours on 150K jpgs which output about 6.5Gigs of JSON data to analyze

PR's welcome.  Find some bugs for me.  I wrote it in three hours or so.
